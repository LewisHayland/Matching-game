This is a fruit matching game that I created to test my JavaScript knowledge I learnt. The aim of this game is to get the lowest score whilst matching all the cards.
This game is about matching the cards by clicking on them and trying to get the lowest score. 
You can then reset the game and restart with the cards being in randomized places again, so you wonâ€™t have a game where the cards in the same location. 
Using a counter there is a real time score of how many points you have collected by pressing on the cards this is then show on the screen by the score increasing.
